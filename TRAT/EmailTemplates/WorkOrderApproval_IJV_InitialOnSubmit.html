    Hi,<p></p>
    Please find the attached Initial Work Order details for project '{ProjectName}' and use the below links for Approval or Rejection.

    <p></p>
   
    Please note:
    <br />
    This is the Initial works order (as indicated on the form). The hours shown on the attached works order are an estimate and not necessarily the hours that will eventually be charged. The DIJV will charge the actual hours spent on the project, keeping the Member Firm project team informed as required.

    The works order has been prepared following discussions with your onshore project team contact (cc’d on this email) and the DIJV will now commence support to your team as requested. If there is any reason why we should not start work please let us know immediately by return.

    Any outstanding information will be progressed with your project team and a Revised works order can be issued at the end of the project with the actual hours charged, if you wish. It is not necessary for the DIJV to issue the Revised works order, unless specifically asked for by your project team.

    If you have any questions please let us know.

    Thanks,
    TRAT team

<p><em>Note :In case you have any comments on the Work order form attached, please send them to the DIJV engagement manager in a separate email.</em></p>
