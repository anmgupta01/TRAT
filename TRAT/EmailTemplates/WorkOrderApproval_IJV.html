    1)	If this is the Initial works order (as indicated on the form) the hours shown on the attached works order are an estimate and not necessarily the hours that will eventually be charged. The DIJV will charge the actual hours spent on the project, keeping the Member Firm project team informed as required.

    The works order has been prepared following discussions with your onshore project team contact (cc’d on this email) and the DIJV will now commence support to your team as requested. If there is any reason why we should not start work please let us know immediately by return.

    Any outstanding information will be progressed with your project team and a Revised works order can be issued at the end of the project with the actual hours charged if you wish.

    2)	If this is a Revised works order any outstanding information will have been updated and the hours will be the latest estimate or actual hours (if the project is finished)

    If you have any questions please let us know.


    Thanks,
    TRAT team
